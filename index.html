                <p>Hello, my name is Zach Soomro.</p>
                <p>Although I have no formal background in the world of coding, I am excited to learn a new skill and explore new opportunities. Prior to learning to code I was studying Molecular Biology and pursing a career in medicine. Despite the fact that full-stack development was very different than my prior courses, I felt that learning to code would help me diversify my skillset. </p>
                <p>Thru my experiences in medical situations I realized that increasing accessibility to high quality care was something I was passionate about. As the intersection of medicine and technology grows I look forward to using full-stack development to help me create a platform for those who cannot currently access the healthcare services they need.</p>
